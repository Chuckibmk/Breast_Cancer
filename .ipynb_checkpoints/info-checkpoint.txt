GROUP 1 PROJECT
Dataset Name: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
Source: Kaggle

Description:
The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset is a classic dataset for binary classification tasks, aiming to predict whether the biopsy result is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on various features derived from digitized images of breast mass.

Variables (32 features):
1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)

(3-32)
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

	a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
	b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
	c) perimeter
	d) area
	e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
	f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
	g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
	h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
	i) symmetry 
	j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~street/images/
